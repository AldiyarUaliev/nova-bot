NOVA Bots
=========

Introduction
-----------
    Nova bots is an easy-to-use python framework for developing multilingual AI-based chatbots 
for businesses or simple conversations. Nova can be used to make automated and intelligent dialogue 
systems like customer support, personal assistance, commercial agents, and more. It is developed with 
the modularity of features in mind (i.e. every functionality of the bot is considered an 'app' and can 
be plugged and removed easily from the system without affecting the Bot itself. This makes the bot 
reusable) and easy to train.


INSTALLATION GUIDE
------------------
...To setup and make the project ready to use, you simply need to download the repo, uncompress it,
install all the required libraries in the *requirements.txt* file in the project repo. To do so, 
simply type in the following command using the command prompt on windows.
*N.B*: A prior basic knowledge of using the command prompt is needed. This assumes that python have
beed installed and pip added to the *ENVIRONMENTAL PATH VARIABLE*. If not, download python from
[Here](http://www.python.org>). Make sure to use python 3.6 or higher. If possible use `virtual 
environments` to isolate the project.
```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
When the installation is over, you can now run the project by following steps below:
```shell
    cd nova
    python core.py
```
The program should then execute and you could chat with the bot. The Bot basic features are:
    - Basic greetings
    ...This means that Nova can reply to simple greetings like 'good morning', 'how are you?'
    ...and 'goodbye'. You will learn how to extend the features further in this guide.
